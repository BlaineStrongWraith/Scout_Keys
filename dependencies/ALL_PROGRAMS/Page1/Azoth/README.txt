Swap characters and uses pet scout talent for azoth
Side Note:
	- VERY IMPORTANT: make sure you spell the TITLE of names (prime pyromancer) correctly in the 'configs_README' txt file 
	- VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure to pop out your pet sigil so it shows the feed pet snack button or else it wont be able to feed happiness
	- Swap realms when there are no reagent for the pet to retrieve
	- Auto feed snacks when pet happiness after each realm swap from the 5TH snack slot
	- Please make sure to setup realm and the place of collecting reagent before hand
	- You can have up to 4 people in the same area with enough characters [Diego, Helephant, Lincoln, Stormzilla]
	- Availble realms are page 2-5, if a realm is set from page 1 or 6 it will be randomnized to a random realm
	- turn off group invite, friend invites and appear offline
	- less than 5 characters use 120/s school scout else use 240/s scout for efficency (mathimatically almost double the amount of azoth but uses x6 the happiness / could hybrid both if possible)
	- Do not group yourself up, wizard101 prompts you to be in the same realm as your friends for some reason (known bug since 2015)
	- recommended: close out every application beside wizard101 and ju3dgement if possible, this is not an issue for most people but will result in less crashes
	- Empty your treasure cards before running if needed
	- If wizard101 has an update, wizserver problems or local wifi problem will break this program. There is nothing to be done
	- On a good night it should run for ~12 hours before running into infinte loading screen
	- Optimal setup with 1 account -> 10 characters -> all 240 second/s scouts should give 2000-3000 azoth in 10-12 hours
	- fire/ice/storm/myth/life/death/balance scouts = 1 azoth / 120s
	- hatch scout = 0 azoth + chance of hatch pappers / 180s
	- elemental/spirit scout = 2 azoth / 240s
	- Webhooks are currently inactive, will be fixed in 1.4
