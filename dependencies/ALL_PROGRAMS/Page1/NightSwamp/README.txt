make sure gauntlet is in castle tour --> friends --> first slot
make sure all accounts used are in the commons before running the bot

Side Note
	- First boss try to one shot kill first round or boss will deal 90% of all your health
	- None of the fights will give mana/health wisp regardless of group, hence this dungeon will retrieve potion, make sure you have ALOT of gold (100k+) before running
	- This dungeon fills up your bank and backpack very fast (15 items a run/ avg 14 housing 1 gear) so make sure to check frequency to clear items
	- Make sure not to kill final boss in 1 shot or else it will revive to full health
